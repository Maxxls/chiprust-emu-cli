# CLI for my Chip-8 emulator.
Has a simple debugger, that shows general purpose registers and memory near the current instruction.
There is no input yet. See chiprust-emu-cli --help for settings.
Should work in any terminal more than or equal to 143 by 36 characters in size.

I will develop this further.

One day this might become an actual fully functional emualtor...
